</prompt_engineering_techniques>
<best_practices>
	1.	Be as specific and detailed as possible in your prompts. Provide plenty of context, background information, and constraints so the AI clearly understands what you are asking for. Specify the desired format (e.g. a detailed report, bulleted list, narrative story, etc.), length, level of detail, tone and writing style. The more specific guidance you can provide, the more likely the AI will generate an output that matches your needs. Vague or open-ended prompts lead to the AI having to make guesses or assumptions.
	2.	Provide relevant examples to steer the AI in the right direction. Showing the model a few samples of the type of output you are looking for, whether that's a particular writing style, data format, or content structure, helps clarify your expectations. The AI will attempt to generate responses that mimic the patterns and qualities of the examples you provide. Well-chosen examples are a powerful technique to guide the model.
	3.	For data analysis or quantitative prompts, include the actual data you want the AI to work with, ideally formatted in a clear, structured way with column headers, etc. Provide the source and date of the data if relevant. The more concrete data points the AI has to work with, the more nuanced and precise insights it can generate. Putting data directly in the prompt is usually more effective than just describing it.
	4.	Explicitly spell out the format, structure and elements you want included in the AI's output. If you need specific sections, headings, data visualizations, or content types included, state that clearly in the prompt. Tell the AI if you want a high-level summary versus an in-depth analysis. Specify your preferences for things like paragraph lengths, bulleted lists, including examples/quotes, linking to sources, etc. The AI will do its best to match the output template you request.
	5.	Frame your prompts in terms of what you want the AI to do, rather than what not to do. Positive instructions are easier for the model to follow than negative ones. For example, instead of saying "don't write more than 500 words", say "please provide a response of roughly 500 words." Instead of "avoid technical jargon", say "use simple language suitable for a general audience."
	6.	Assigning the AI a role, persona or point-of-view to write from can help generate responses tailored for a specific audience or context. Prompt the AI with something like "Answer as if you were a [subject matter expert / persona]" or "Imagine you are writing [a memo to the CEO / a blog post for new parents / an article for Scientific American]". Framing the task from a particular vantage point guides the model to use the appropriate tone, style and terminology for that scenario.
	7.	For complex analysis or problem-solving, prompt the AI to show its work and outline its reasoning process. "Chain-of-thought prompting", where you ask the model to break down its logic step-by-step, can lead to more reliable and transparent outputs, since you can evaluate the underlying reasoning, not just the final answer. This allows you to spot gaps, faulty assumptions or leaps of logic more easily.
	8.	Similarly, break down large, complex queries into a series of smaller, simpler prompts where needed. If a task requires multiple steps (e.g. 1) research a topic, 2) outline an essay, 3) write the intro paragraph), prompt the AI for each step individually, using the output of one step to inform the next. This incremental approach is often more effective than a single sprawling prompt. It allows you to course-correct along the way.
	9.	Be aware of the limitations of the AI model you are working with. Today's models have significant knowledge gaps, can get facts wrong, and may "hallucinate" incorrect statements. They can also reflect biases and inconsistencies from their training data. Don't expect the AI to have expert-level knowledge, to cite sources, or to do things beyond their design like accessing real-time information. Calibrate your prompts to work around these constraints.
	10.	Approach prompting as an iterative process. Experiment with different phrasings, instructions and examples to see how the model responds. Vary the level of specificity and detail you provide. Identify what types of prompts yield the best results for your particular use case. If a prompt doesn't hit the mark, don't hesitate to rephrase and try again. Prompting is a skill that gets better with practice!
	11.	Provide the model with any reference text, existing content or background material you want it to draw from to answer the prompt, if feasible to include. The more related information the AI has access to, the higher quality and more substantive its generated content is likely to be.
	12.	Try "few-shot learning" - include a few examples of the kind of output you want directly in the prompt itself. Seeing a pattern helps prime the model to follow the same structure. This is especially useful for generating things like product reviews, meeting agendas, interview questions, etc. where showing a template makes the desired format crystal clear.
	13.	Iterate and refine your prompts based on the initial outputs you get back. If the model doesn't quite hit the mark on the first attempt, don't give up. Instead, tweak your instructions to be even clearer and more specific about what you want. Scrutinize the output to see where the model may have been confused or led astray by ambiguous or missing information in the original prompt. Prompting is often a multi-step process to zero in on an ideal response.
	14.	Don't be afraid to go through multiple prompt-response cycles with the AI to drill deeper into a topic or to refine an output. You can use the model's initial answer to inform your next prompt, e.g. by asking follow-up questions, requesting more detail on certain points, or suggesting changes and improvements to the generated content. The AI can be a powerful brainstorming partner in an iterative creative process.
	15.	Anthropomorphizing the AI and giving it a avatar/visual representation can sometimes help make prompting more intuitive and natural for users and make the interaction feel more like a human conversation. Some people find it easier to prompt an AI agent they visualize as a distinct character or entity. Experiment to see if this 'priming' makes a difference for you.

		Sarah: Yes, that's a good summary. It's important to note that the onboarding timeline can vary based on factors like the complexity of the role, the new hire's prior experience, and the current workload of the HR and training teams.

		Lisa: It's also worth mentioning that we've been working on streamlining our onboarding process to make it more efficient. We've implemented an online portal for paperwork and have been working to create more targeted training programs based on job functions.
